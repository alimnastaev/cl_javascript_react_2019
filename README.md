## My Code Louisville React Class final project (May, 2019)

This is simple `GitHub explorer` app 

I used `GitHub Api V.3` for the project: [https://developer.github.com/v3/](https://developer.github.com/v3/) (no need any APY KEYS)

It has 4 pages and 3 routes (`ReactRouter` implemented).
To make HTTP requests `.fetch()` method and `axios` library were used.

- `Home` page: just a title page
- `User` page: type a username to find out how many total repos that user has
- `Language` page: type language to find out how many total repos associated with that particular language
- `Licences` page: will show you available licences avaialable on GitHub

The app is responsive (`Bootstrap 4` implemented).


### To start the app:

`npm install`

`npm start`
